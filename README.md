ABOUT APPLICATION
------------------

This is a remote server application that listens for incoming connections and processes various commands from a client. 
It allows remote control of a computer by simulating mouse movements, clicks, keyboard inputs, and media controls. 
The server listens on port 8080 and provides the local IP address for the client to connect.

Once connected, the server can receive and process commands such as:

Mouse Movement: Moves the mouse by the specified delta values in the X and Y directions.
Mouse Click: Simulates left or right mouse clicks.
Keyboard Input: Sends text input to the active field.
Keyboard Backspace: Simulates the backspace key press.
Enter Key: Simulates the Enter key press.
Media Control: Controls media playback by simulating Play/Pause, Stop, Next Track, or Previous Track actions.
Media Input: Simulates media-related keyboard input, such as navigating with arrow keys or muting.
Open Bookmarks: Opens predefined URLs (like YouTube, Google, ChatGPT, etc.) in Google Chrome or the default browser.
Fullscreen: Toggles fullscreen mode on the computer.
Close Window: Closes the application window.
The application provides real-time interaction with the remote server, simulating user input for automation, remote control, 
or even for testing purposes.
